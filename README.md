This is a multimedia player that gets its material from the database of www.youtube.com, as well as dailymotion, vimeo, odysee (possibly not working in the moment) and archive.org. 
It can play audio only (the original concept of this program), but can play video as well. 
Selecting such preferences happens under the menu „quality“.
It‘s also possible to make playlists, which can be saved.

The code as it is now is – I think – a pretty good base for further development.
